# RogueShield: AI-Powered Threat Detection & Forecasting

RogueShield is an AI-powered threat detection and attack forecasting system built using TensorFlow, Streamlit, and SHAP. It classifies network intrusions in real-time, forecasts future attack patterns, and maps results to the MITRE ATT&CK framework — making it a powerful tool for cybersecurity automation and intelligence.
